# FiveM-Pool

Prototype for a client side physics engine that can be used for a pool / 8ball game. Currently only the physics engine itself is implemented, actual game rules and sync still has to come.

# Debug Usage

To try out the pool table the following commands can be executed:

```
spawnTable
spawnBalls
attachCam
```

After these commands 'b' can be used to increase the power, 'c' to lower it and 'f' to shoot the ball.
